# Definition Of Group


**Definition 1.1.**{:#definition-group} 
A *group* is a non-empty set $G$ together with a binary operation $\cdot$ on $G$ *s.t.* following three requirements, known as *group axioms*, are satisfied:

1.	$\forall a, b, c \in G: (ab)c=a(bc)$
2.	$\exists e \in G \forall a \in G: ae=ea=a$
3.	$\forall a \in G \exists b \in G: ab=ba=e$


$e$ in (2) is called the *identity element* (or *identity*) of $G$, $b$ in (3) is called the *inverse* of $a$ in $G$, denoted by $a^{-1}$. The group is often denoted by $(G, \cdot)$ (or simply $G$). The cardinality of $G$ is called the *order* of $G$.
If moreover, $\forall a, b \in G: ab=ba$, then $G$ is called an *abelian* (*commutative*) group.

**Remark 1.**
The identity and inverse of an element are unique.

**Remark 2.**
The name *abelian* is from the abelian equation, see .

In this chapter, we let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group.
## Subgroup And Quotient Group


**Definition 1.2.**{:#definition-subgroup} 
A *subgroup* $H$ of $G$ is a subset of $G$ which forms a group under $\cdot$, written by $H \leq G$. $H$ is a *maximal subgroup* if $H$ is proper *s.t.* no proper subgroup contains $H$ strictly.

**Remark 1.**{:#definition-generate-remark-1}
The intersection of a family of subgroups of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$.

**Remark 2.**
Let $g \in G, H \leq G$, then $gHg^{-1}$ is a subgroup of $G$, called the *conjugate group* of $H$.

**Definition 1.3.**{:#definition-generate} 
Let $S \subset G$ be non-empty. Let $H$ be the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $S$ (such group exists by [Remark 1@Definition 1.2](#definition-generate-remark-1)). Then $H$ is said to be *generated* by $S$, written by $H=\langle S\rangle$. $S$ is called the *generators* of $H$.

**Remark 1.**
$G$ is said to be *cyclic* if it can be generated by a single element $g \in G$, and finitely generated if it can be generated by a finite subset.

**Remark 2.**
The *order* of an element $g \in G$ is the order of $\langle a\rangle$, denoted by $\operatorname{ord}(g)$. One has $\operatorname{ord}(g) \mid \left|G\right|$.

**Remark 3.**
The exponent $\operatorname{exp}G$ of $G$ is the least common multiple of $\operatorname{ord}(a), a \in G$. $\operatorname{exp}G$ is finite if and only if $G$ is finite, and we have $\operatorname{exp}G \mid \left|G\right|$.

**Definition 1.4.**{:#definition-coset-double-coset} 
Let $H, K\leq G$. A $H$-*left coset* of $G$ is a subset of $G$ of type $gH, g \in G$, the set of all $H$-left coset of $G$ is denoted by $G/H$. The right coset is similar.
A $(H, K)$-*double coset* of $G$ is a subset of $G$ of type $HgK, g \in G$, the set of all $(H, K)$-coset of $G$ is denoted by $H\backslash G/K$. The cardinality of $H$-cosets of $G$ is denoted by $\left|G: H\right|$, and is called the *index* of $H$ in $G$.

**Remark 1.**
The cosets of $G$ form a partition of $G$. The indexs of left cosets and right cosets are equal, and we have $\left|G\right|=\left|G: H\right|\left|H\right|$. In particular, $\left|H\right| \mid \left|G\right|$.

**Definition 1.5.**{:#definition-normal-subgroup} 
A subgroup $H\leq G$ is a *normal subgroup* if $\forall g \in G: gH=Hg$, denoted by $H \trianglelefteq G$. A group with only $2$ normal subgroups is called a *simple* group.

**Remark 1.**
A subgroup $H \leq G$ is normal if and only if $G/H=H\backslash G$.

**Remark 2.**
If $N$ is normal in $G$, then $N$ is normal in any subgroup of $G$ containing $N$.

**Remark 3.**
Any subgroup of abelian group is normal.

**Remark 4.**
Let $N \trianglelefteq G$. For $x, y \in G$, we write $x \equiv y \bmod H$ if $xN=yN$.

**Remark 5.**
Let $H\leq G, N \trianglelefteq G$, then $H \cap N \trianglelefteq H$.

**Definition 1.6.**{:#definition-quotient-subgroup} 
Let $N \trianglelefteq G$, then $G/N$ admits a group structure inherits from $G$: $aN\cdot bN=abN$. $G/N$ is called a *quotient group* of $G$ by $N$.

## Group Homomorphism


**Definition 1.7.**{:#definition-group-homomorphism} 
In $\operatorname{Groups}$, the morphism is given by $f: G \to H$ that respects $\cdot$.

1.	the *image* of $f$ is $\operatorname{im}f=f(G)$
2.	the *kernel* of $f$ is $\operatorname{ker}f=f^{-1}(e_{H})$



**Remark 1.**
Let $N \trianglelefteq G$. $\phi: G \twoheadrightarrow G/N, g \mapsto gN$ is called the *canonical map*.

**Remark 2.**
The automorphism of a group $G$ froms a group $\operatorname{Aut}G$.

**Remark 3.**
$\operatorname{im}(f)\leq H, \operatorname{ker}f \trianglelefteq G$. $f$ induces a sequence of groups and group homomorphisms
\\[G \twoheadrightarrow G/ \operatorname{ker}f \xrightarrow{\sim}\operatorname{im}f \hookrightarrow H\\]

**Isomorphism Theorem Of Groups.**{:#proposition-isomorphism-of-group} 
1.	if $H \leq G$ and $N \trianglelefteq G$, then $H \twoheadrightarrow HN/N, h \mapsto hN$ induces an isomorphism
	\\[H/H \cap N \xrightarrow{\sim}HN/N\\]
2.	if $H, N \trianglelefteq G, H\leq N$, then $G/H \twoheadrightarrow G/N, gH \mapsto gN$ induces an isomorphism
	\\[(G/H)/(H/N)\cong G/N\\]


## Centralizer, Normalizer And Commutator


**Definition 1.9.**{:#definition-centralizer-normalizer} 
Let $S \subset G$.

1.	the *centralizer* $Z(S)=\left\\{g: \forall s \in S: gs=sg\right\\}$
2.	the *normalizer* $N(S)=\left\\{g: gS=Sg\right\\}$


$Z(G)$ is called the *center* of $G$.

**Remark 1.**
$Z(S), N(S)$ are subgroups of $G$, and $Z(S)\leq N(S)$.

**Remark 2.**
$Z(G)\trianglelefteq G$.

**Remark 3.**
The normalizer $N(H)$ of a subgroup $H$ is the largest subgroup of $G$ *s.t.* $H \trianglelefteq N(H)$.

**Remark 4.**
Let $H, K \leq G$ with $K \leq N(H)$, then $H \trianglelefteq HK$, and $K \twoheadrightarrow HK/H, k \mapsto kH/H$ induces an isomorphism $K/K \cap H \xrightarrow{\sim}HK/H$. In particular, $\left|HK\right|\left|H \cap K\right|=\left|H\right|\left|K\right|$.

**Definition 1.10.**{:#definition-commutator} 
The *commutator* of elements $g, h \in G$ is $[g, h]=g^{-1}h^{-1}gh$. Let $H, K \leq G$ be subgroups, the *commutator subgroup* of $H, K$ is $[H, K]=\langle [h, k]\rangle_{h \in H, k \in K}$.

**Remark 1.**
$[G, G]$ is the smallest normal subgroup with abelian quotient, denoted by $G^{c}=G/[G, G]$. The process of making $G^{c}$ is called the *abelianization* of $G$. Any homomorphism of $G$ into an abelian group factors through $G^{c}$.
